# Bristol HPC Performance Portability Studies

This repository contains data from the UoB-HPC performance portability studies, along with scripts to reproduce it.

## Structure

The repository is organised as follows:

* [benchmarking](benchmarking/) contains build and run scripts for the applications in the study, updated every year
* [metrics](metrics/) contains data and helper scripts to plot it
